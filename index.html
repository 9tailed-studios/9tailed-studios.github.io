                        9tailed Studios was started with a driving purpose: to create games with purpose.
                        We believe video games are a sophisticated art form that have great potential as
                        vessels for dynamic stories and mentally engaging, thoughtful gameplay. We believe
                        games should keep the mind sharp, and for those games with strong story elements,
                        should engage the heart in a meaningful narrative that reflects higher truths.

                            Vulpes Divinus is the working title for an open-world 2D platformer with a focus
                            on engaging combat and in-depth story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The combat consists of both weapon-based combat and magic. As you progress throughout
                            the game, you will gain items which increase your power and create synergies that
                            result in satisfying destruction of evil.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The narrative details a cataclysmic collision between light and darkness, a conflict
                            whose stakes are as high as possible. But in the midst of this universal conflict, you
                            will encounter creatures in their everyday lives, and will see the impact that your
                            divine quest truly carries.
