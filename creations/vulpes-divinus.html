                        Vulpes Divinus is our founding project &mdash; a vast, open-world 2D platformer with
                        advanced combat and an immersive narrative. It is still in the early stages of
                        development.

                    <h2>Investigate the World</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vulpes Divinus takes place in Tekia, a massive land of enchantment and mystery.
                        Created by the incomprehensible Theryx, Tekia was meant to be a perfect work of art, but
                        the jealous Quyryx was overtaken by pride and turned against Theryx, infecting Tekia
                        with corruption. He became Kyryx, Dark Lord of Sin, and he seeks nothing more than to
                        destroy every last trace of truth, goodness, and beauty in Tekia.

                    <p>
                        Explore Tekia, from its highest mountain peaks, to its eternally autumnal forests,
                        to its darkest secretive depths. The world is brimming with unique locations to explore,
                        with many secrets, allies, and enemies along the way. As you discover secrets, you will
                        find unique items to empower yourself; as you find allies, you will embark on quests to
                        help heal the wounds caused by Kyryx's corruption; as you encounter enemies you will
                        use your natural agility and divine blessings to quell the infection of sin in the land.

                    <h2>Build Your Character</h2>
                    <p>
                        As you progress through the game, choose how you want to engage in combat, whether your
                        prefer to focus on honing your weapons or channeling your divine power. With a variety of
                        weapon archetypes and unique ability sets, you can choose your own play style. Prefer to
                        poison enemies and stay out of harm's way? Focus on the abilities granted by the powerful
                        Karion. Would you rather keep your distance and snipe enemies at range? Track down the
                        Essence of Instinct and become an Airscourge, gaining bonuses to your ranged weapons and
                        improved mobility.

                        local, secondary story quests to explore. Interact with characters throughout Tekia
