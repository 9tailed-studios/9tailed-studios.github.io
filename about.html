                        9tailed Studios is an independent game development team based out of the Midwestern
                        United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We've set out to create games with gameplay that truly engages the mind and stories
                        that reflect higher truths. We are a proudly Christian studio, and as such, we care
                        that our games have high quality all around and do not waste players' time. Time is
                        a precious and finite gift, so it is important to us that the time spent playing our
                        games is time well-spent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Being a Christian studio doesn't mean we are afraid to delve into deep topics, or to
                        present antagonists that are manifestly evil. You won't find us including obscenity
                        or positive portrayals of evil in our games, but we don't shy away from conveying the
                        darkness which is ultimately dispelled by the light.
