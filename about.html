                        9tailed Studios is a video game and software studio started with a sense of purpose
                        and a passion for quality in games and software. Our first project, currently titled
                        Vulpes Divinus, was the inspiration to form a team dedicated to collaborating on
                        this project and projects like this.

                        We are a Christian game studio, and we seek to glorify God through our projects. We
                        seek to provide joy through mentally stimulating gameplay and meaningful stories that
                        reflect higher truths. We seek to avoid heavy-handed metaphors in favor of subtle
                        parallels in stories that have value in and of themselves. We love Scripture, and we
                        take inspiration from it and the values it communicates, but our stories are not
                        derivatives of it. Instead of writing narratives that are one-to-one copies of
                        Bible stories, we write stories to be true, good, and beautiful in their own unique
                        way.
                    </p>

                        Unlike some Christian groups that seek to make their games as "safe" and "sanitized"
                        as possible, we want to tell realistic stories that may contain some gritty elements
                        that aren't meant for young children. You can be assured that our games won't contain
                        obscenity or any positive portrayal of evil, but we do write stories that deal with
                        dark and heavy subject matters. As such, we target a more teenage and mature audience.
